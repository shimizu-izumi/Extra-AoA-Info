### Extra AoA Info ###
This mod is an addon to Advent of Ascension.

Currently, it does four things:
* Adds dynamic DPS values to all AoA and some vanilla weapon tooltips
* Adds dynamic Energy/sec values to all AoA Blasters
* Adds Armour value differences on armour pieces

Currently broken things:
* Displays a HUD in the top left corner when using AoA weapons that shows the required ammo counts.

The aim of this mod is to add additional information to AoA that may not be suitable for the base mod.
It also serves as an example add-on mod for people looking to learn how to integrate with AoA

If you have suggestions for more information that can be displayed from this mod, create a discussion in the Discussions tab, or feel free to contribute yourself with a pull request, as this addon is open-source.
